# Tabletop Game Recommendation Engine

## Overview
This is a personal project, where I developed a board game recommendation engine using content-based filtering. This project was created to enhance my skills in ETL, EDA, and text processing, as well as providing a recommendation engine for exploration of new table top games I would like to play.

This is for anyone interested in exploring potential boardgames, card games, or any other physical game played on a tabletop to play, based on an existing game you already like. 

This uses data from Board Game Geek, which was extracted using their public ranked board game dataset and API, with some inital filters that restrict the game recommendations to games which are the base game, average rating of 7/10 and at least 100 votes for this rating.
